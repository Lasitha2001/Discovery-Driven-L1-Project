## About Our Product

### This project introduces an innovative and interactive educational hardware solution designed to captivate children's interest in the realms of science and in programmable tools for cognitive development, our initiative emphasizes the fusion of physical and digital elements, creating a dynamic learning experience. This game aims to deliver an entertaining and educational game for children, fostering early engagement with technology and introducing a fresh perspective on learning. Please read the manuals carefully before using this product. You can get correct operation method, simple and detailed installation procedure.

## Methodology

* The robotic car navigates to the object on the floor. 
* The robotic arm grasps the object, performs necessary movements, and turns counterclockwise. 
* The arm gently places the object onto the stage, allowing it to slide down an inclined plane to the sensing area. 
* The object is identified and processed by various sensors in the sensing area. 
* The processed information is sent to a web server, providing the game challenge to the user. After processing, the object is automatically removed via a gate at the end of the processing area.

## How to play

* The game consists of 5 levels.
* The game starts at Level 1. After completing Level 5, the game ends with a congratulatory message.
* Follow the instructions provided in the website to complete each level.
* Before starting a level, always make sure to place the boxes so that the white cross marks (X) on the boxes are facing up.


## Levels
### _Level 1: Colour Identification (Identify the colour of the cardboard box)_ 
### _Level 2: Number Identification (Identify the number on the cardboard box)_ 
### _Level 3: Material Identification (Identify the material of the object)_ 
### _Level 4: Number and Color Identification (Identify the number and color of the cardboard box)_ 
### _Level 5: Mathematical Operations (Solve a math problem and choose the correct numbered box)_
